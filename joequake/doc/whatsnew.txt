optimized lerping issue to work by actual fps instead of max fps
fixed bug when unnecessary lerping on some temp entities makes them look jerky if cl_maxfps is <= 72

====================================================================================

 version 0.16.2 build 6320 (hotfix)
 -----------------------

-fixed wrong behaviour of host_framerate and cl_demospeed variables with independent physics.

-fixed choppy fps if cl_maxfps was not set as a multiple of 72 (when using ind. phys.)

-fixed order of available refresh rates in the video options menu (they are in ascending order now).

-added show_speed_interval setting from NeaQuake.

-added a 6th built-in crosshair option (circle). Use "crosshair 7" to enable it.

-fixed bug when splitting marathon demos with demarathon.exe resulted faulty .dem files
 (error message: Demo message > MAX_MSGLEN).

-fixed bug when custom crosshair images were drawn incorrectly at specific sizes.

-fixed bug when starting with Quake with the command line params -width/-height did not
 create a proper fullscreen mode.

-fixed bug with ambient sound playback in case of cl_maxfps > 72 (when using ind. phys.)

-added command line switch -norawinput to provide option for discarding raw mouse input.

-fixed model animations in case of independpent physics and cl_maxfps > 72

====================================================================================

 version 0.16.2 build 6300
 -----------------------

-changed independent physics to be the default option from this version.
 unfortunately it was not possible to flawlessly implement this feature. it turned out
 that it is problematic to cap the server's fps at exactly 72.0, and let the client use
 unlimited fps as this behavior resulted misaligned server - client frames which lead to
 anomalies/malfunctions in the game's physics. so a slightly modified solution was done
 which kept the computation method of server fps (entirely) and so client frames are
 aligned to the server frames. the downside of this solution is that fps feels pretty
 choppy/bad if it is not a multiple of 72 (the server's fps). so you'll have bad
 experience with cl_maxfps like 85, 100 or 120, but it'll work pretty well with values
 like 72, 144, 216 and so on.
 the default value of cl_maxfps is remained at 72, so if you don't want to take advantage
 of the higher fps, you shouldn't notice any change.
 if you want to disable independent physics, use the -noindphys command line paramater.

-added raw mouse input from NeaQuake

-added automatic demo recording
 there are 2 new cvars: cl_autodemo and cl_autodemo_name.
 automatic demo recording works along the following algorithm:
 -if cl_autodemo is 0, there is no recording
 -if cl_autodemo is 1 and cl_autodemo_name is empty, a new .dem file is recorded at
  every level start. the file naming format is <map_name>_<date_of_recording>_<time_of_recording>.dem
 -if cl_autodemo is 1 and cl_autodemo_name is not empty, the <cl_autodemo_name>.dem file
  is recorded at every level start - yes, it is the same file every time. if you want to
  keep the recording, you can use the new 'keepdemo' command. this command is only valid
  on the intermission/finale screen and renames your temporary recording using the
  following naming format: <cl_autodemo_name>_<finished_time>_<skill>_<player_name>.dem

-added on-the-fly vid_bpp (color depth) change
 after setting this cvar's value in the console, the game automatically tries to switch
 to the desired color depth mode. you can also find this option in the video menu.
 setting vid_bpp to 0 will force the override to switch off, meaning the game will use
 the default (desktop) color depth at the next startup.

-video options menu now shows a confirmation message after a video mode change, where
 the user can confirm or revert the changed resolution.

-renamed cl_oldbob to cl_newbob and changed its role: from now it enables the new Q3
 style weapon bobbing instead of enabling the old style bobbing. also restored the view
 weapon's original viewsize-dependant height in case of old bobbing.

-added fix from NeaQuake, when in coop demos, stats could show incorrect values from
 pr_global_struct.

-bugfix: video modes are properly queried again, thanks to the tip from R00k.

-bugfix: intermission text was not positioned properly if scr_sbarscale_amount was higher
 than 1.

====================================================================================

 version 0.16.1 build 6258
 -----------------------

-framerate independent physics (BETA only, can be switched on optionally)
 separated server and client fps. from now the client may display as many fps as
 possible. an fps cap can be set by the cl_maxfps cvar, by default 72.
 the server (and therefore the physics) always run at a max of 72 fps - just like since 
 the beginning.
 this new behavior can be controlled by the cvar cl_independentphysics, default is 0.
 to turn it on, use "+set cl_independentphysics 1" at the command line.
 demo recording is not yet possible if cl_independentphysics is 1.

-added dynamic video mode change
 from now the default video mode is the desktop resolution. 
 the video mode is saved to the config file and restored during the next startup.
 there is not need to define vid_modes at every restart by -width/-height or -mode params.
 you can of course override this by the regular line switches if you want to.
 the goal with this solution is to keep the starting command line as simple as possible
 and give users a modern, more convenient way to set their preferred resolution.
 setting vid_mode to 0 will force the override to switch off, meaning the game will
 use the default (desktop) video mode at the next startup.

-new video options menu with interactive resolution change support

-added on-the-fly vid_displayfrequency change
 there's also no need to use "+set vid_displayfrequency <xy>" during startup.
 after setting this cvar's value in the console, the game automatically tries to switch
 to the desired video mode. you can also find this option in the video menu.
 setting vid_displayfrequency to 0 will force the override to switch off, meaning the game
 will use the default (desktop) display frequency at the next startup.

-got rid of vid.conwidth, vid.conheight stuff completely (removed -conwidth, -conheight
 options too) from now ONLY scr_sbarscale_amount can be used to specify the scaling
 (from 1.0 to 4.0)-

-added gl_externaltextures_gfx cvar to support switching off hi-res menu and sbar images.
 since Quake loads these images right at the startup, you need to specify the value of
 this cvar via "+set gl_externaltextures_gfx 0" in the command line.

-bugfix: capturedemo crashed if absolute path was set using '/' characters instead of '\'

-bugfix: removed adding svc_stufftext "reconnect" at SV_Reconnect, so it won't fuck up
 multilevel demos anymore.

-bugfix: when navigating in the demos/maps menu was working wrong: in case of not in the
 beginning of the list and going up via UPARROW, the cursor mistakenly was set to the end
 of the list.

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 5288
 -----------------------

-from now r_wateralpha does NOT affect teleports with '*teleport' textures, since it
 looked horribly ugly. Probably gonna add a cvar for it, if required.

-bugfix: con_notifytime is affected by cl_demospeed/host_framerate.

-extended gl_part_muzzleflash for the soldier and enforcer models either.

-fixed bug when the user could screw the console's fontsize by adding a very large
 number after -conheight, for example -conheight 1500 was treated as valid.
 From now, Quake converts the conheight parameter to the same aspect as the video frame.
 So, if Quake is started in 1024x768 (4:3) resolution, and the console's resolution is
 640x400 (16:10), then the conheight will be converted to the 4:3 equivalent value,
 and the resulted console resolution will be 640x480.

-removed cvar initializing lines from default.cfg (in joequake's pak0.pak).
 Also changed a few cvar's default values to be more user friendly when Quake is
 started for the first time.

-fixed bug when vid_vsync was not set to 0 properly after startup.

-added scr_widescreen_fov cvar, default value is 1. From now the fov is properly
 calculated in 16:9 resolutions also.

-removed scr_scalemenu cvar, the menu is always displayed in a proper size.

-added scr_sbarscale_amount cvar, default value is 2. It controls how much the
 console font and status bar icons are scaled. You don't need to use -consize and
 -conwidth any more from the command line when starting Quake.

-changed the default allocated memory to 128 Megabytes.

-added new style weapon bobbing code. If you still prefer the old style, use the
 'cl_oldbob' cvar to turn it back.

-added a complete new Options menu system with a ton of options to adjust.
 My main goal with this feature was to make JoeQuake easy-to-customize for newcomers
 who do not know the shitload of cvars, but just want a client which can be set
 up easily.

-added an alternative HUD with cl_sbar 2.

-from now the JoeQuake package comes with various built-in crosshairs and console
 fonts which can be set from the new menu system.

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 3798
 -----------------------

-fixed bug when recording marathon runs with QdQStats: the summarized time was not
 displayed at the end of the map when finishing multi-level runs.

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 1862
 -----------------------

-fixed bug when playback of demo file with corrupted header got system to hang up.

-extended the effect of gl_picmip to .mdl and .md3 files either.

-added particle muzzleflashes from QRack. You can enable/disable it via the
 gl_part_muzzleflash cvar. Note that you need to restart the map if you change
 it to take effect as it requires the model to be reloaded.

-added decals from QRack. Cvars are gl_decal_blood, gl_decal_explosions,
 gl_decal_bullets and gl_decal_sparks. They all speak for themselves. Also gl_decaltime
 for the amount of seconds and gl_decal_viewdistance for the distance how far the
 decals can be seen.

-added stencil shadows, "r_shadows 2" to use it. I kept the old shadow too since
 the use of stencil buffer results a massive performance loss.

-fixed a bug with video capturing when the game got freezed if capturedemo was
 stopped with capture_stop command.

-fixed a bug when compressing the audio to mp3 during video capturing. If there's
 any mp3 encoder exist in the system, Quake _does_ find and use it.

-added r_fullbrightskins 2 mode: among the player, it also changes the skin of
 monsters to full bright as well.

-made a workaround for the "e2m2 bug" which occurs when playing on easy skill and
 the players shots only one button at the beginning to enter the citadel and the
 game freezes. It won't crash from now on, but results a Host_Error call.
 I know I could've fix this bug for real I mean to not even drop the Host_Error
 but keep running. The problem is (once again) loosing backward compatibility with
 older Quake engines if a demo recorded in e2m2 using JoeQuake gets played in an
 other engine, it will still cause the crash.

-added lightstyle interpolation to both GL and software versions.
 Start e1m1 and check the flickering light at the beginning of the map to see the
 effect. In my opinion it rocks skyhard :)

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 1329
 -----------------------

-added gl_part_telesplash 2 for Q3 style teleport effect. Note that you have to
 copy the Q3 teleport model (Quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3/models/misc/telep.md3) into
 your joequake/progs/ directory and the teleport texture
 (Quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3/gfx/misc/teleportEffect2.jpg) into your
 joequake/textures/q3models/ directory in order to get this working.

-removed gl_part_spiketrails cvar. The underwater spike affected bubble trails
 are controlled via the gl_part_trails cvar from now.

-fixed a bug when a dedicated server was started.

-added gl_lerptextures cvar. Its role is the same like gl_lerpimages in FuhQuake
 with the addition of lerping the player's texture as well even when it's colored.
 The texture lerping was default and unchangable in previous versions of JoeQuake
 but the resampling possibility of the playertexture is a new feature.
 By default, this cvar's value is 1.

-fixed showing ping in deathmatch overlay.

-removed gl_part_inferno cvar as it wasn't used anymore for a while.

-added mouseware support for logitech 8-button mice.
 Usage is the same as in FuhQuake (i.e. -m_mwhook at the cmd line).

-faster vertex lighting on md3 models.

-added gl_part_damagesplash cvar. When turned on, it draws a Q3 style on-screen
 damage splash when the player gets hurt.

-added gl_part_gunshots 2, gl_part_spikes 2 and gl_part_flames 2 for Q3 style
 gunshot, spike and flame effects. Note that you have to copy the Q3 gunshot model
 (Quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3/models/weaphits/bullet.md3) into your joequake/progs/
 directory and the gunshot textures (Quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3/models/weaphits/bullet1,2,3.jpg)
 into your joequake/textures/q3models/ directory in order to get the gunshots and
 spikes working.

-r_viewmodelsize now works for .md3 weapon models too.

-fixed a bug with .md3 weapon models when they were drawn badly sometimes.

-implemented "early commands" from FuhQuake (it was high time). This means you need
 to use the "+set" command line switch from now instead of exact command line
 modifiers: I removed -22khz, -44khz and -displayfrequency switches and added
 "s_khz" and "vid_displayfrequency" cvars. The usage is quite simple: you need to
 use the +set switch in the command line to setzp the value of these cvars.
 For example "+set s_khz 44" or "+set vid_displayfrequency 85". The above mentioned
 entirely hide what is changed in the system.

-added cl_chatmode variable: if turned on (1), everything that Quake can't interpret
 (not command or cvar or alias) is sent as chat. Similar to QW clients, you don't
 have to type "say " every time you wanna say something. Default value is "1".

-due to conflicts from the default cvar_savevars setting, I decided to not live
 with the automatic saving option, which means that from now cvar_savevars defaults
 to the value "0".

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 1189
 -----------------------

-added vid_vsync cvar from FuhQuake, to override the default vsync settings of
 your graphics card's driver. Default value is "0" which means vsync is turned off.

-added -displayfrequency command line switch which works similar to FuhQuake's
 vid_displayfrequency cvar: the value given after -displayfrequency will override
 your monitor's refresh rate.

-gl_smoothmodels's bug has been fixed.

-v_gunkick's bug has been fixed, and changed cvar's behaviour:
 when using with value 1 the weapon kicks the original (old) way.
 when using with value 2 the kick is much smoother just like in QW.

-_windowed_mouse works properly now, even if the game starts in windowed mode and
 _windowed_mouse is turned off.

-server list now works properly: it saves the file servers.txt every time even if
 it wasn't created before. Also, the saving of server description names which
 contain spaces have been fixed.

-added function to a few keys during demoplayback (originally made by Sputnikutah):
 LEFTARROW plays the demo rewind
 RIGHTARROW plays the demo forward
 UPARROW increases the playback speed (cl_demospeed)
 DOWNARROW decreases the playback speed
 ENTER sets default demospeed and plays it forward

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 1146
 -----------------------

-iplog commands now get registered only if you start quake with the -iplog
 command line switch (previously iplog commands were accepted but refused to
 work if one didn't use the -iplog switch, but now they won't even get accepted).

-changed iplod.dat's location: from now it places out in the main quake folder
 so it can be commonly used between other engines like QRack, similarly to
 servers.txt.

-changed cmdhist.dat's location: from now it places in the joequake dir.

-made the server list one line shorter: the last line prints help on editing
 the list.

-when using volumeup or volumedown, the same sound gets played just like when
 using the options menu's volume slider bar (idea by Baker).

-fixed namemaker menu's bug (not changing the name properly).
 From now it works the following way: pressing ESCAPE in the namemaker menu
 won't modify anything, while pressing ENTER will, BUT won't replace the
 player's name with the new one, it only shows up the new name in the
 multiplayer setup menu. You NEED to press "accept changes" here to get the
 changes taking effect.

-added cl_keypad cvar to toggle between the using of keypad or not, 1 by default.

====================================================================================

 version 0.15 build 1140
 -----------------------

-added png screenshot format support to the software version.

-renamed scr_sshot_type to scr_sshot_format.

-added server list from FuhQuake as it was requested. It uses the same
 servers.txt file like the QW engines so it's compatible with them.
 Reachable via console as well using the menu_slist command.

-added "mp optimized" to the options menu. When turned on, it changes a
 few variables to a value which is - in general - an optimal setting when
 playing a multiplayer game. The settings are the following:

 lookstrafe 0
 lookspring 0
 v_kickroll 0
 v_kickpitch 0
 v_kicktime 0
 cl_bob 0
 cl_rollangle 0
 scr_conspeed 99999

 Note that using this will change your custom settings on these cvars.
 Turning off changes them back to their DEFAULT values.

-renamed cfg_savevars to cvar_savevars.

-added IP logging from ProQuake. New commands are "ipdump", "ipmerge" and
 "identify". Note that I haven't tested it yet, so there's a slight chance
 that it won't functional 100% well. Any feedback is highly welcomed.

-confirmation on starting a new single player game can be accepted via
 ENTER from now, not just the 'y' button.

-renamed pq_lag to cl_lag.

-added a new default.cfg into JoeQuake's pak0.pak. The zoom_in binding to
 F11 is removed in this config, because it screwed up the sensitivity of
 the mouse if it was accidently pressed. Also, bindings to the '+' and '-'
 keypad keys are added with volumeup and volumedown.

-added support for keypad keys. Should've been added long ago...

-added 2 new commands: volumeup and volumedown. volumeup increases the
 volume by 0.1 and volumedown decreases by the same value. The maximum
 volume is 1.0, it won't raise higher than that. You'll see a graphical
 volume control bar at the top right corner of the screen for 2 seconds
 any time you change the volume using volumeup or volumedown.

-renamed scr_printstats* cvars to show_stats*. Also there's show_stats_small
 instead of scr_printstats_style to indicate that the drawing is done with
 smaller console characters.

-cl_confirmquit is now applied to the game's window as well
 (closing the game using the 'X' button on the top-right corner).

-maps menu works different when playing deathmatch:
 it changes level ("changelevel" command) instead of disconnecting and 
 starting a new map ("map" command).

-from now, there is the opportunity to record the console screens either
 during video capturing. The cvar for it is capture_console, 1 by default.

-added a "Name maker" menu (menu_namemaker) as a submenu in the net setup
 menu. You can now create any kind of names for yourself in a pretty damn
 easy and comfortable way.

-removed the shadow alpha slider from the video options menu. From now
 the transparency of shadows' cannot be adjusted directly. It's counted
 by the height of the object from the ground.

-added "bestweapon" command from ProQuake.

-ping is now printed in deathmatch overlay.
 UPDATE: no, it's broken, and it only shows "0" every time. Requires fixing.

-added show_fps_x and show_fps_y cvars. You can now place them anywhere.

-screenshots are now placed in joequake/shots directory.

-fmod.dll is now placed inside joequake dir to avoid problems when other
 engines' fmod.dll overwrote it.

-scr_sshot_type is now "jpg" by default.

-added new key bindings to keys menu, but they only show up if you start
 the game with the -runequake command line switch (RuneQuake specific).

-added new cvar "freelook", does the same effect like -mlook/+mlook.

-added new menupoints to options menu, removed a few unused ones.

-removed gl_interpolate_* cvars, since I removed non-interpolated mode in
 the OpenGL version.

-renamed "bump mapping" to "detailed textures"

-added scr_autoid from FuhQuake, but it's very beta. I shouldn't even
 have mentioned it here :)

-added cl_smartjump from FuhQuake.

-QMB lightning splash fixed (thanks to sputnikutah/Justin Thyme).

-added _luma support on both mdl and md3 models.

-removed gl_picmip_all cvar, this means all objects are mipped from now,
 and mipping can't be turned off coz it looks fucking ugly that way.

-added q3 style explosion (gl_part_explosions 2), blood (gl_part_blood 2)
 and trails (gl_part_trails 2).

-added md3 support. You can either place it to the progs or to the maps folder
 depending which models you wish to replace. For example progs/grenade.md3 will
 replace the grenade.mdl model and maps/b_rock0.md3 will replace the b_rock0.bsp
 rocket ammo box. So you can replace brush models too. The texture files are not
 separated, all of them need to be placed in /textures/q3models folder.

-loading from jpg, saving to jpg. This means you may use jpg textures as well,
 JoeQuake will load it. Note that the loading order is tga, png, jpg. And you may
 also use scr_sshot_type as "jpg" or "jpeg" to save the screenshots in that format.

-cfg_savevars defaults to 1.

-removed gl_clipparticles. This is now automatic just like in quake3.
 And particles are not only clipped from 1st person view but always instead.
 This means that even in refilmed demos the player model is never hidden by
 some particles (looks better).

-Modified q3 rocket and grenade smokes a bit to get them looking better.

-fixed r_rockettrail 0 in QMB.

====================================================================================

 version 0.14 build 839
 ----------------------

-removed r_explosiontype's mode when particles were unaffected by 
 gravity (value 1).
-changed QMB trails slightly: r_rockettrail/r_grenadetrail 1: default
 smoke, 2: darkplaces style colored smoke, 3: Q3 style smoke. So there's no
 gl_q3particles anymore. Also added new (beta version) Q3 style explosion
 sprite for QMB, try gl_part_explosions 2. And gl_part_blood 2 for getting
 Q3 style blood.
-cl_advancedcompletion worked wrong, this has now been fixed.
-sound capturing now works right if host_framerate is changed (slowmo/ffwd).
-Some changes in the states of scr_printstats:
  0 - off
  1 - only time
  2 - time + kills + secrets
  3 - only time, only when action
  4 - time + kills + secrets, only when action
-added mp3 audio compression for avi capturing. Cvar capture_mp3 toggles it, and
 capture_mp3_kbps sets the bitrate (128 by default).
-video capturing is now supported in software JoeQuake too.
-added capture_dir, default is "capture".
-v_gunkick now affects demoplaying as well (thx to Nolan for pointing out).
-raised maximal number of supported video modes from 30 to 128 (my stupidity,
 should've done much earlier).
-added gl_part_spiketrails (to keep Stubby happy).

====================================================================================

 version 0.14DEV (3rd release)
 -----------------------------

-added a cvar called "cl_advancedcompletion" which toggles between
 advanced and normal (old) command/cvar completion (i.e. you can now turn
 advanced completion off). Default is "1" (advanced on).
-gamma changing now possible in windowed mode too with setting
 vid_hwgammacontrol to "2".
-added -22khz and -44khz starting parameters into linux versions.
-gl_smoothfont's default value is 0 from now.
-joequake GLX is finally available!
-alias models (.mdl files) are affected by dynamic lights as well.
-added vertex lighting and texture quality support into video options menu.
-"gl_picmip_all" is now 1 by default.
-added vertex lighting support from AMFQuake, cvar is "gl_vertexlights"
 and its value is "0" by default.
-paramater completion is now working with loadcharset, gl_consolefont and
 crosshairimage commands.
-you can now use "gamma" and "contrast" commands under GL as well to change
 gl_gamma and gl_contrast cvars.

====================================================================================

 version 0.14DEV (2nd release)
 -----------------------------

-stair step ups now really smoothed out, just as the gun's knockback.
-modified a few QMB particle effects, mainly from the AMFQuake engine:
  -changed lavaball trails
  -changed torch's fire
  -nails now throw bubble trails when firing underwater
  -improved shambler's lightning
-added variable "gl_q3particles" to enable q3 style blood and smoke trails
 when using the QMB particles.
-set back automatic startdemos sequence, but not supported by joequake. This
 means that it won't start playing the demos back unless you delete the quake.rc
 from the joequake directory (inside pak0.pak) or use another one with
 startdemos included.
-added "gl_solidparticles" cvar: if your fps lowers when drawing particles, try
 switching this to 1, hopefully it helps.
-added "loadcharset" command and  "gl_consolefont" cvar: now you need to load
 the charsets, they won't automatically be loaded, but you can specify which
 you want to load and also can modify it during the game. Charsets go to
 textures/charsets/ dir.
-got the 72 fps limit to work only when recording demos.
-added "gl_externaltextures_world" and "gl_externaltextures_bmodels" cvars.
 This means you can turn external textures off if you wish and they won't
 automatically be loaded.
-plenty of minor bugfixes.

====================================================================================

 version 0.14DEV (first release)
 -------------------------------

-added "cl_confirmquit" variable, to disable confirmation when exiting the game.
 Default value is "1" (confirmation required).
-Modified the role of "r_shadows" a bit: from now, it changes the transparency
 of the shadow, similarly to r_wateralpha, 1 means non-transparent (opaque black),
 while 0 means fully transparent (no shadow).
-non-multitextured mode (-nomtex) was screwed up, this has now been fixed.
-added "gl_fb_models" and "gl_fb_bmodels" variables to enable/disable fullbright
 textures. I heard that on some video cards fullbright textures could be fucked
 up, so people having this problem can turn fullbrights off.
 The default value is set to "1", for both variables.
-raised maximal number of edicts from 600 to 2048.
-QMB torch flames didn't work properly, this has now been fixed.
-fixed a problem with player models: DME models weren't colormapped as they
 are not regular player.mdl files, but I extended the comparison for them too.

====================================================================================

 version 0.13 Final (bugfix release)
 -----------------------------------

-fixed a bug with the player model (it hadn't changed back to default
 player.mdl when it was replaced with something else, like the head model
 in case the player was gibbed).
-fixed messagemode echo bug.
-fixed a bug with security/enforcer lasers (they were red/blue colored when
 they were not supposed to).

====================================================================================

 version 0.13 Final (5th release)
 --------------------------------

-added "cl_maxfps" cvar to customize the maximal fps. Default is "72".
 You can only lower this if you're playing single player or coop.
-added "cl_gibfilter" cvar to avoid gibs. Can be "0" (on) or "1" (off).
-added "cl_deadbodyfilter" cvar to avoid corps. The main reason for this is
 that you are not allowed to use "coop 2" (QdQstats) on maps with only one
 starting spot.
 You can choose between value "1" and "2". At the first case, the dead body is
 to be removed in the last animation frame. At the second case it is removed
 immediately when the monster/player dies. Its value is "0" (off) by default.
-added "getcoords" command. It writes the player's origin into a given file
 or to "camfile.cam" if there was no name given.
-removed blue/red glows from the powerups' models which were hacked onto them
 from the engine side. They're still supported, but only from the progs
 (i.e. the mod) side (meaning EF_BLUE and EF_RED here).
-fixed cl_bobcycle's clipping bug when it was set to "0".
-added recording without demoname (easyrecording). If you don't give a name
 after the "record" command, it'll use a format similar to the following example:
 E1M1-Jan-04-2004-134408.dem - which means that the recording was done on
 E1M1, in the 4th of January 2004, started at 13:44.08 (hours:mins.secs).
-added a new menu called "Maps" into mainmenu. It shows all the available
 maps from your mod directory (if given) and also from your id1/maps dir.
 I think this "id1/maps" is the most common directory for maps for everyone
 but tell me if I'm wrong. It also shows maps from pak files as well.
-added record-after-connecting from ProQuake. Now you can start recording
 without reconnecting to the server.
-fixed chase camera in software version: it only showed the weapon model
 instead of the player, until now.

====================================================================================

 version 0.13DEV (4th release)
 -----------------------------

-added Nehahra support. Use -nehahra at the command line if you want to
 use Nehahra with JoeQuake.
-renamed "dem_rewind" to "cl_demorewind".
-Added particles submenu into the Video Options menu. Now you can set each
 variable the _most_ pleasant way. From the console, you can reach this
 menu via the "menu_particles" command.
-fixed rogue's missing color mapped explosion (my mistake). Also created
 QMB style version of it.
-modified writeconfig command: it's depended on a new cvar called
 "cfg_savevars" which variables will be saved. If cfg_savevars is "0"
 than it saves only archieved vars (regular, as it worked so far). If "1"
 it'll save the ones which have other than default values (i.e. changed).
 And with value "2" it'll save ALL variables.
-integrated ctrl+v (paste) function into the console.
-restored "exec quake.rc" at the beginning, and disabled popping up
 Main Menu automatically.
-renamed "r_ringalpha" to "gl_ringalpha".
-extended underwater QMB smoke trails with bubbles.
 (thanks to sputnikutah@hotmail.com for the idea)
-raised number of chat characters in a message (ProQuake).
-same commands typed in the console won't be saved multiple times.
-"Connected to JoeQuake server" will now only be printed when playing
 mulitplayer game.
-replaced the QMB torch model with a better one, also modified the flames
 to - hopefully - make them look better than before.

====================================================================================

 version 0.13DEV (3rd release)
 -----------------------------

-added NAT support from ProQuake.
-disabled "r_fullbrightskins" for multiplayer.
-added qflood protection from ProQuake.
-renamed "r_r2g" cvar to "cl_r2g".
-removed "gl_colorlights" cvar and added "gl_loadlitfiles". This one only
 denies the static colored lights, but not the dynamic ones.
-added -no24bit command line parameter, you can disable loading those high
 resolution textures if you use this switch.
-added synthetic lag from ProQuake. Cvar is "pq_lag", 0 by default.
-added "rcon" command from ProQuake.
-changing of r_skybox now take effect immediately, w/o restarting the map.
-added "gl_smoothfont" cvar. Now you can turn off this feature.
-added 5 new crosshairs from FuhQuake, and also new variables to configure
 crosshairs even more: crosshairsize, crosshaircolor, crosshairalpha (GL),
 and crosshairimage, with this last one you can load a custom image as crosshair.
-added q3-style bobbing, you can turn it on/off with "cl_bobbing" cvar.
-removed alpha from shadows, they're now full black.
-added precise aiming from Proquake.
-added "scr_printstats_style" cvar: when using with value "1" it replaces
 scr_printstats's HUD numbers with console characters.
-added "cl_clock" cvar which turns on/off the local time. I've built in 4 different
 formats to the values 0, 1, 2 and 3, hopefully you'll find the one that fits the
 best for you (in case you'd like to use this feature). Also added "cl_clock_x" and
 "cl_clock_y": these represent the x and y coordinates of the clock on the screen.
 Play with the values if you aren't satisfied with the default position.
-added the possibilty of changing water caustics from the video options menu.
-added -m_smooth command line parameter: It smoothens your mouse movement even
 more. Use it only with -dinput. Also, set m_rate to the refresh rate of your mouse
 (in Hz). If you don't know this value, you can check it out with m_showrate cvar.
-mission packs' status bars will be updated properly with using their own
 gfx.wad, even when not using -<name> or -game <name> (this means you switch
 to the mission pack folder inside the Demos menu).

====================================================================================

 version 0.13DEV (2nd release)
 -----------------------------

-gamma and contrast changing from menu under GL didn't work, fixed this.
-fixed missing "r_fullbright 1" in GL.
-now, the game doesn't exit after "capturedemo" finished.
-banned cl_truelightning bigger than zero for demorecording.
-now player.mdl has shadow as well.
-dzip extraction now works only with version > 2.5 (v2.9 included in the zip).
-dzip extraction now works from subfolders as well.
-txt file after dzip extraction will be deleted from now (if exists).
-scr_printstats now work also when cl_sbar is 1.
-added "r_ringalpha" cvar. It sets the transparency of your weapon
 model when you're invisible, default is "0.4". Under GL only.
-added linux svgalib support (squake).
-added CAPS LOCK to bindable keys list.
-added "gl_caustics" cvar. It results improved underwater quality.
-fixed strange freezing bug when mission pack was started.
-extended r_rtrail's function: 0 - no trail, 1 - normal trail, 2 - grenade trail, 
 3 - alternative rockettrail (QMB only).
-added "gl_part_flames" cvar. With the help of this you can toggle between
 QMB like torches and normal ones.

====================================================================================
