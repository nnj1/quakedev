All sets come with color variations, with exception of a few. This makes for many textures to import and process. As a result, I have not cut up many of the trimsheets into separate trim textures, as this would result in several hundred textures to process. If you need your trims separated, feel free to cut them up yourself. I would otherwise encourage you to use the trims as a sheet, it's better for organization and performance, and makes it extremely easy to swap to different colors.

These textures were built for and look best in Nearest filtering.
