maps distributed for examples of intended uses of textures, please do not use geometry/brush work from maps in part or in whole for your own projects without permission. if you grab a door or two to use though, that's probably fine.

recommended to have all makkon wads loaded, as they are often used together. if you are having trouble loading any wad, please make sure that you are using the latest version of Trenchbroom. if you are still having issues, recommended that you only load 1 wad at a time to see how they are used.

compiled versions of the maps are available as well as a last resort. maps compiled for Arcane Dimensions 1.8.
